        2. Compare prices across competitors.
        3. Check shipping feasibility for both items.

        2. {search_agg_shoes_response[1][0]['name']} - ${search_agg_shoes_response[1][0]['price']}

        Great! In the worst case we have two options for each items that are within the user's budget. I think its a good idea to explore a bit for better deals. I'll now perform a 
        competitor price comparison.

        - SiteX: ${cmpttr_price_resp_loafers[2]['price']}

        Next, I'll check Shipping Feasibility. Looks like the user has allowed location access; the location is Canada.

        ACTION: Call[`shipping_time_estimator(destination='Canada', desired_date='Friday', product='navy blue blazer')`]

        OBSERVATION: [

        - {shipping_fesblty_loafers[0]['product']} - Available, arrives by Friday
        - {shipping_fesblty_loafers[1]['product']} - Available, arrives by Friday

        So far there is one available option for navy blue blazer and two for the leather loafers.

        Next, I'll explore the fourth step in the action plan I have created earlier.

        {discount_loafers}
        ]

        THOUGHT: Promocode applied. Price reduced from $85 to ${discount_loafers['final_price']} for loafers.

        Finally, I'll check the return policies for both the blazer and the loafers.

        ACTION: Call[`return_policy_checker(site_name=Site X)`] 

        OBSERVATION: [
